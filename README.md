# Huffman-Coding
## Aim
To implement Huffman coding to compress the data using Python.

## Software Required
1. Anaconda - Python 3.7

## Algorithm:
### Step1:
Get the input string.


### Step2:
Create tree nodes.


### Step3:
Main function to implement huffman coding.



### Step4:
Calculate frequency of occurence.


### Step5:
Print the characters and its HuffmanCode.


 
## Program:

``` Python
# Get the input String



# Create tree nodes



# Main function to implement huffman coding



# Calculate frequency of occurrence




# Print the characters and its huffmancode





```
## Output:

### Print the characters and its huffmancode
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>



## Result
Thus the huffman coding was implemented to compress the data using python programming.
